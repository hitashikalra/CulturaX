CulturaX
CulturaX is a cultural event management system that provides a RESTful backend for efficient handling of user interactions and event management processes. Built with Flask, this application allows users to create, register for, update, and delete events while ensuring data integrity and security through JWT authentication.

Features
Event Management: Create, list, update, and delete events.
Registration: Users can register for events, and manage their tickets.
JWT Authentication: Secure user authentication for accessing protected routes.
Input Validation: Robust data validation and sanitization to prevent malicious inputs.
Tech Stack
Backend: Flask
Database: SQL (e.g., MySQL or PostgreSQL)
Authentication: JSON Web Tokens (JWT)
Deployment: AWS (Amazon RDS for database, EC2 for hosting)
Installation
Prerequisites
Python 3.8 or higher
pip
A database server (MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.)
AWS account (for deployment)
Clone the Repository
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/CulturaX.git
cd CulturaX
Create a Virtual Environment
bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
Install Dependencies
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Set Up Environment Variables
Create a .env file in the root of your project and add the following variables:

plaintext
Copy code
FLASK_APP=app
FLASK_ENV=development
DATABASE_URI=your_database_uri
SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
Replace your_database_uri with your actual database connection string and your_secret_key with a secure key for signing JWTs.

Database Migration
If using Flask-Migrate, run the following commands to set up your database:

bash
Copy code
flask db init
flask db migrate
flask db upgrade
Running the Application
To start the Flask application, use:

bash
Copy code
flask run
The application will be available at http://127.0.0.1:5000/.

API Endpoints
Authentication
Login: POST /api/login
Request body: { "user_id": "your_user_id" }
Returns a JWT token for authenticated sessions.
Event Management
Create Event: POST /api/events
Request body: { "name": "Event Name", "date": "YYYY-MM-DD", "location": "Event Location" }
List Events: GET /api/events
Update Event: PUT /api/events/<event_id>
Request body: { "name": "Updated Event Name", "date": "YYYY-MM-DD", "location": "Updated Location" }
Delete Event: DELETE /api/events/<event_id>
Ticket Management
Register for Event: POST /api/registrations
Request body: { "event_id": <event_id>, "user_id": <user_id> }
List Tickets for Event: GET /api/events/<event_id>/tickets
Deployment
For deployment on AWS, you can use EC2 instances for hosting and Amazon RDS for your database.

Create an EC2 instance and set up your Flask application.
Configure RDS and connect it to your Flask application by updating the DATABASE_URI.
Make sure to set the necessary security groups for your instance to allow HTTP/HTTPS traffic.
